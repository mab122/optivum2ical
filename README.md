# optivum2ical
Scraping timetable from website generated by [optivum vulcan](//www.vulcan.edu.pl/dla_szkol/optivum/plan_lekcji/Strony/wstep.aspx) and exporting it to [iCal format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) for easy use everywhere.

Maybe even self-hosted auto-updating solution.

W.I.P.

It works on example.html file and generates schedule.ical

That's it for now.
